## Time

_Dear time, where did you go  
It seems like yesterday was just a moment ago  
The present fleeting, I run behind  
The everlasting past stuck in my mind  
Living in the moment ain't easy 'cause  
The future is now, the moment is lost  
As my tomorrows engulf today  
I realise time is here to stay  
With each year, I feel like time  
Has gone ahead, and left me behind  
Afraid I lost the best years I had   
I feel a creeping sense of sad  
But once in a while, I look behind  
And see how far up I've climbed  
Carrying my loved ones close by  
I've pulled them up quite high_  

_As time has passed, 22 years have gone  
And what a beautiful journey it was._ 


Love you bhaiya :)
