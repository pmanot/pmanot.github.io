_Thoughts like dandelions in the wind  
Swept away by waves of air  
The mind is an open field  
Dandelions scattered everywhere_

_What you thought was stuck in place  
Is as fickle as the leaf on a tree  
What you desperately try to hold  
Evades your touch and slips free_  

_Feelings you try to keep  
Morph slowly but incessantly  
Soon the cocoon is broken  
Emotions disenthral, set free_  

_Who are you then  
If mind and body changed  
When you look back  
Your past feels estranged_

_As you try to steady yourself     
Try to stay the same  
To keep your thoughts intact    
But alas, they go as they came_    

_The captain of your ship  
You try and hold your ground  
In the deafening uproar of the sea  
Hopelessly deadened to sound_  

_Left desolate, confused  
Mindlessly obscure, powerless  
Chasing who you once were  
For now seems a mess_  

_How easy it is to look back  
And point to who you were   
But not knowing what today might be  
Makes the mind perturb_

_When you look in the mirror  
Afraid of who you might be  
You've changed so much now  
What do you see ?_

_Your reflection temporary  
An image only to be seen  
For no matter how hard you try  
You will never be what you've once been_  

_Your past becomes your shadow  
Your future looming ahead  
The present constantly changing  
Uncertainty filled with dread._

_So fearful of change  
The frail mind believes its own lie  
Living in a lucid dream  
Stagnant while the waves go by_ 

_But nothing escapes the clutches of time  
Slowly but surely your raft drifts off  
So wrapped up in your own delusion  
You notice not as your path distorts_ 

_Unbeknownst, you look back into your ocean of memories  
Realising not how your journey warped  
You feign surprise as if you knew not  
Of the currents that carried you off_

_There is no end to this odyssey  
The road unsteady and drunk_  
**It is you, the insensate traveller  
Whose feet defeated, become numb.**
