*Thoughts like dandelions in the wind  
Carried by the waves of air  
Aimlessly roaming the skies  
A journey unending and unfair* 

*What you thought was stuck in place  
Is as fickle as the leaf on a tree  
What you desperately try to hold  
Evades your touch and slips free*  

*What you thought would never change  
Deceptively transforming incessantly  
Replaced before you know it  
Disenthralled, set free*  

*As you try to steady yourself     
Try to stay the same  
To keep your thoughts intact    
But alas, they go as they came*    

*The captain of your ship  
You try and hold your ground  
In the deafening uproar of the sea  
Hopelessly deadened to sound*  

*Left desolate, confused  
Mindlessly obscure, powerless  
Trying to hold on to life  
But life is just a mess*  

*When you look in the mirror  
Afraid of who you might be  
You've changed so much now  
What do you see ?*

*Your reflection temporary  
An image only to be seen  
For no matter how hard you try  
You will never be what you've once been*  

*Your past becomes your shadow  
Your future looming ahead  
The present constantly changing  
Uncertainty filled with dread.*

*So fearful of change  
The frail mind believes its own lie  
Living in a lucid dream  
Stagnant while the waves go by* 

*But nothing escapes the clutches of time  
Slowly but surely your raft drifts off  
So wrapped up in your own delusion  
You notice not as your path distorts* 

*Unbeknownst, you look back into your ocean of memories  
Realising not how your journey warped  
You feign surprise as if you knew not  
Of the currents that carried you off*

*There is no end to the odyssey  
The road unsteady and drunk  
It is you, the insensate traveller  
Whose feet defeated, become numb* 

- Purav
