Welp, it's been a while since I've actually committed myself to writing for my blog. I almost forgot about it entirely, but no more - from now on I'm going to try and be as regular as possible. (_Procrastination no more!_)

There's a lot I want to do in my life right now - _Finish school, travel, start working and become financially independent (like my brother), travel and explore new places, step up my fitness game, improve my sleep, blah blah blah..._  

These are pretty thoughts, but right now that's all they are! What I really need to ask myself is:

> _"What am I doing now to achieve them ?"_.  

Honestly, I'm not doing much. And what I am doing feels _scattered_ and _inadequate_ - I feel like I'm _stuck in a rut_. To actually asses whether I'm doing enough or not, and what I can be doing, I've realised I need to start not just doing things willy-nilly, but keeping track of how often and when I do them, and constantly setting goals, completing them, and reviewing my progress. To actually do something, I need to set **concrete goals** for myself, things I can start doing **now** - and **actually start doing them.**

So I've decided I'm going to try to write down exactly what I plan on doing, and make a log of how I'm progressing with it. I've realised that recording what I'm doing and what I'm not will help me actually **keep track** of how productive I am, and how well I follow-up with what I decide to do. _No more wasting time and fooling around, it's time to get serious and start actually doing things._

I've categorised what I want to **do / learn / achieve** in the near future: 

* **Lifestyle changes**: Any major change in my lifestyle, that could take anywhere from a few days to few weeks to implement.

* **New skills**: Any new skills I want to acquire, that will take time and focus to properly learn.
* **Fitness**: Any goals or challenges I want myself to accomplish regarding my fitness.
* **Study**: Any studying goals I set for myself, including or outside my current school syllabus.
* **Reading Goals**: Any goals related to reading, scientific or fiction.
* **Immediate goals**: *Goals I can accomplish within a short period of time, that change frequently. These goals will act as stepping stones for my other goals, and I will keep setting milestones for myself with a time limit and reviewing them as I progress.*
* **Other / Untagged**


A goal can be part of more than one category. I plan on using these categories like **tags** rather than strict differentiators.

> _For example, since I am currently learning to handstand, I would  categorise it as follows:_
> 
> **Handstand -> Skill**
* duration: indefinite  
* aim: hold a freestanding handstand for 15 seconds  
* Tags: [Fitness, New Skills] 


Each skill/goal will be documented or written about in either a post or a collection of posts, where I can either add new posts, or update the page regularly.
Hopefully in the near future you'll find posts to follow-up this one, and be able to read about all the new things I learn and do.
  
Anyway, that's about it for now - see you later soon :)

**_Sayonara!_**
