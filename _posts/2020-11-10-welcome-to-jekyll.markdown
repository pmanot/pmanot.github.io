In biology, evolution is simply the process through which living organisms adapt to their environment. But what do we mean when we talk about a *species* evolving ?

Before we try and answer that, let's get some preliminary questions out of the way:

> What is a species ?  
 *A species is a group of organisms that share a genetic heritage and are capable of interbreeding to create fertile offspring*

> Let's look at dogs for a second. All dogs are definitely not the same. The AKC recognises 190 different dog breeds. But all of them still belong to the species of **dog**. This simply means that even if you have two different breeds of dogs, they can still reproduce and make cute adorable babies. In fact, many dog breeds are actually created by having two different breeds reproduce and over multiple generations, creating a **new** breed, that has its own unique traits, inherited in part from its parents.
> Now imagine trying to breed a dog and a cat. The genes of these two animals are so different from each other that even if they physically mated, there would be no fertilisation. This is because dogs and cats belong to different **species**. This is just a rigid way of saying that their DNA is very different from each other. Of course, there are still variations in DNA **in** a species too. But their genetic makeup is similar enough for them to be considered as the same species.
