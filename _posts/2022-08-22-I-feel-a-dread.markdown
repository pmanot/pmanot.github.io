_I feel a dread creeping  
A wave of blue, approaching from afar_  

_I look it in the eye, as it comes near  
Floating in an ocean of fear_  

_My head is above, I haven’t drowned yet  
Isn’t it funny, how we seem to fret_  

_Over mixed memories, emotions, and consciousness  
Sometimes I let the waves take over_  

_Eyes shut, yet completely sober  
A sense of calm in this sea of noise_  

_I let myself go, in solitary poise  
Entering lands I make in my head  
Reality fades and I feel the dread_  

_How do I know if my vision is blurred  
When I can never see the fabric unfurled  
The woven mesh of reality, in which I abide  
My mind, with mere senses to guide_    

_I cannot escape the illusion I create_  

_Like an ant teetering on the edge of a leaf  
Are we simply hanging on to reality by our senses_  

_What we think of as real_  

_Could just be a dream in someone else’s mind_  

_Perhaps the dread stems from her kind  
Maybe she sees things better than I do  
Maybe she creates that wave of blue_  

So sometimes, I let it take me.
